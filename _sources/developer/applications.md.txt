# Applications

Applications specifically written for helloSystem, especially Preferences and Utilities applications, should be
* Simple to use
* Easy to hack on
* Open Source (2-clause BSD licensed by default, but similar permissive licenses may also be acceptable)
* Ideally written in PyQt
* Come as simplified `.app` bundles with no external dependencies apart from what comes with helloSystem by default on the Live ISO

Please see [https://github.com/learnpyqt/15-minute-apps](https://github.com/learnpyqt/15-minute-apps) for what we mean by "Simple to use" and "Easy to hack on".
