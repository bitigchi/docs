# Keyboard

The __Keyboard__ preferences application lets you change the keyboard layout (language) of your attached keyboard.

``` .. note::
    The keyboard layout (language) gets set automatically during system startup if an official Raspberry Pi keyboard is attached or the system is running on Macintosh hardware, which has the prev-lang:kbd EFI key set.
```
